## Learning Objectives

* Write basic CSS rules using class, id, relational, and pseudo-class selectors
* Describe the priority rules determining CSS specificity

---

## Selectors - Classes

Purpose: to define a rule that applies generally

```css
.highlight {
  background-color: #F2FF00;
}
```

---

### Selectors - IDs

Purpose: to define a rule that applies to a single element

```css
#call-to-action {
  color: red;
}
```

---

## You Do

Add a class and an id style rule to the Keanu project.

* General Sibling - `~`
* Direct Child - `>`
* Descendant - ` `

Note:
Still using codepen example demo.

## Selectors - Pseudo Classes

* `:first-child`
* `:nth-child`
