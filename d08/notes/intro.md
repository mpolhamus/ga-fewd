## Questions

* Still struggling with the two-column mockup
* What are your other favorite grid options?
* Why do you create a different class="grid" div for each row, but we didn't do that in the first example?
* I noticed in your two-column grid solution the background color and boarder weren't redefined for the .middle class, only for .box.
